# DATA CLEANING & ANALYSIS
This project involves cleaning and working on 'layoffs' dataset using MySQL.  

# Data cleaning:
The cleaning process involved the following steps:<br>
	-> removing duplicate entries <br>
	-> standardising the data <br>
	-> Dealing with NULL and blank values <br>
	-> Remove redundant columns/rows <br>

  I'll update the repo once the analysis part is done.... stay tuned.....
